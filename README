# Project Name

    Matcha - Dating website

## Description

    This project is about creating a dating website.
    The app will allow two potential lovers to meet, from the registration to the final encounter.
    A user will then be able to register, connect, fill his/her profile, search and look into the profile of other users, like them, chat with those that “liked” back.
    The project is divided into three parts:
    - The website: the user will be able to register, connect, fill his/her profile, search and look into the profile of other users, like them, chat with those that “liked” back.
    - The server: it will manage the HTTP requests and the Websocket connections, between the website and the app.

## backend

    The backend is written in Node.js and uses Express.js as a framework.
    It uses a Postgres sql database to store the data.
    It uses Socket.io to manage the websocket connections.
